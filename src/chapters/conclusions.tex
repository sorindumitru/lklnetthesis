Because of \textbf{LKL} is implemented as a virtual architecture, is is expected
that the its performances are reduced when compared with a computer running \textb{Linux}.
There might be a speed bottleneck with the hub or bridge, but test haven't proven or disproven
this. Although transmission speeds are not very big, the application is still very useful. Users can
see how protocols and devices work.

All of the main objectives have been implemented in the application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All the devices work as expected, as it can be seen in the devices tests
	\item Large number of devices, as proven in the scalability tests in \ref{sec:scalability}
	\item External applications can be connected to the \textbf{\project} devices, as it has
been done in \ref{sec:complex-network}
\end{itemize}

Using the GUI built over the hypervisor new user can more easily create complex topologies and run simulations
on them than it would have been using the command line tools and configuration files. Users will be able to configure
most of the aspects of the devices using this interface so there is no need to learn to use the command line. More than
this, in the devices the autocomplete feature of the readline library makes is easy to see available commands and
to run them.
