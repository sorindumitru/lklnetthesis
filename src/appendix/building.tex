\chapter{Building the application}

\todo{Try to move Makefile.lkl in Makefile.am and update this}

For a build system I chose GNU Autotools. This allows building
and installing the application with only three well-known commands:

\lstset{language=bash,caption=Build System}
\begin{lstlisting}
  make -f Makefil.lkl
  ./configure
  make
  make install
\end{lstlisting}

The first step is used to build LKL from the linux kernel sources; it
requires the LKL sources, their location is specified in a variable in
Makefile.lkl. This step is only required only on the first build or
when something has changed in the LKL sources.
