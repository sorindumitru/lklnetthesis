LKL-net is a network simulator that supports the simulation of
many Linux based network devices, such as routers, switches and
firewalls. It is based on the Linux Kernel Library, which means
it uses the whole TCP/IP stack from the Linux kernel, and can
take advantage of all the improvements done in the Linux kernel.
